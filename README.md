# Servers

A test project developed as part of a university lab assignment. It implements a client-server application model that performs operations on matrices (viewing, addition, multiplication). The project includes a program interface and two servers. The first server generates matrices based on a specified seed, while the second server performs operations on them. Data is transferred between servers via a TCP channel, and between the client and the server via an HTTP channel in JSON format. The program code is written in the Java programming language.
